  "Title": "Grieving the Dream",
  "Overall Purpose": "To fully grieve the venture, role, or vision that is ending so that love for what it was can coexist with clarity for what comes next.",
  "Why This Matters": "Un-grieved dreams keep us entangled with the past. Deliberate grief protects coherence, restores energy, and prevents old longings from distorting new work.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When a startup path, identity, or cherished plan is ending (or needs to), and you want a clean, human, future-facing way to let it go.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Grief is bypassed or performed. Energy stays stuck; the past quietly steers the future.",
    "Expected": "Grief is felt and named without drama. You can honor what was and release it.",
    "Excellent": "Grief becomes a source of insight and continuity. Gifts are carried forward, residue is cleared.",
    "Transcendent": "The goodbye enlarges you. Love for the dream becomes fuel that stabilizes a wiser next chapter."

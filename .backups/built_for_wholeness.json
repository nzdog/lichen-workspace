  "Title": "Built for Wholeness",
  "Overall Purpose": "To realign with the principle that people and systems are not meant to fragment themselves to fit external demands. Wholeness is strength, not weakness.",
  "Why This Matters": "In startups and high-pressure contexts, founders often split themselves—professional vs. personal, rational vs. emotional, visionary vs. executor. This protocol restores coherence so that energy is not wasted maintaining false divides.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When you feel fragmented, are pressured to shrink or compartmentalize, or sense that parts of yourself or your team are being excluded to fit an external mold.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You keep splitting roles or selves. Burnout rises as suppressed parts leak sideways.",
    "Expected": "You name the fragmentation, invite the hidden parts back in, and act from greater coherence.",
    "Excellent": "You create conditions where the team can hold complexity and contradiction without collapse.",
    "Transcendent": "Wholeness becomes a cultural norm—your startup thrives by including humanity, not editing it out."

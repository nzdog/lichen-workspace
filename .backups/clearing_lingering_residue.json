  "Title": "Clearing Lingering Residue",
  "Overall Purpose": "To release the emotional, relational, and energetic residue that lingers after conflict, endings, or intense transitions.",
  "Why This Matters": "Even after resolution or closure, leftover tension can silently erode trust, clarity, and vitality. Clearing residue ensures that energy flows cleanly into what’s next.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "After conflict, endings, or decisions where the surface seems settled but subtle heaviness or unease remains.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Unspoken residue lingers, dragging energy backward and reopening old wounds.",
    "Expected": "You name and release what’s left, restoring clarity and moving forward cleanly.",
    "Excellent": "You transform residue into insight, strengthening trust and resilience.",
    "Transcendent": "Residue becomes compost—fuel for future coherence, growth, and wholeness."

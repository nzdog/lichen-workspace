  "Short Title": "Pacing Adjustment",
  "Overall Purpose": "Help founders slow down or speed up to align with system rhythm.",
  "Why This Matters": "The Speed of Trust and Clarity Over Cleverness remind us that pacing, not force, sustains growth.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When work feels rushed, stalled, or misaligned.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Pace mismatched, trust eroded.",
    "Expected": "Adjustments restore balance.",
    "Excellent": "Pacing becomes a leadership skill.",
    "Transcendent": "System-wide coherence emerges as rhythm aligns."

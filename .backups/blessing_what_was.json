  "Title": "Blessing What Was",
  "Overall Purpose": "To close a chapter with integrity by actively blessing the people, choices, and work that have brought you here—releasing attachment without denial and making room for what wants to emerge next.",
  "Why This Matters": "Unconscious endings leak energy. Without an intentional blessing, residue lingers: second-guessing, hidden resentment, or self-blame. A clean blessing preserves the gifts, removes distortion, and restores momentum.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When a project, role, relationship, phase, or venture is ending—or you sense it should—and you want to honor it fully so that you carry forward only what’s alive.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "The ending is avoided or rushed. You oscillate between blame and nostalgia. Energy remains tied up in the past and decisions drag into the next chapter.",
    "Expected": "You name the ending, acknowledge what worked and what didn’t, and offer a sincere blessing. Energy begins returning to the present and future work.",
    "Excellent": "You complete specific acts of closure, communicate with care, and ritualize the blessing. The team’s narrative shifts from loss to continuity and learning.",
    "Transcendent": "The ending becomes a multiplier: gratitude expands the field, old patterns compost into signal, and a new chapter arrives lighter, clearer, and more potent."

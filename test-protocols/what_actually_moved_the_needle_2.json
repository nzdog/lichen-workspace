  "Title": "What Actually Moved the Needle",
  "Short Title": "Moved the Needle",
  "Overall Purpose": "To identify and focus on the specific actions, decisions, or events that truly advanced progress toward goals, separating signal from noise.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without clarity on what really drives results, teams risk investing in low-impact activities and missing opportunities to double down on what works.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "During retrospectives or post-mortems\nAt the end of a project cycle or major milestone\nWhen prioritizing next steps in a strategy\nTo evaluate effectiveness of investments in time, money, and energy",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "No distinction between high- and low-impact actions → The future sees repeated waste and diluted focus.",
    "Expected": "Some awareness of high-impact actions but inconsistent application → The future delivers occasional wins but slow overall progress.",
    "Excellent": "High-impact actions are identified, shared, and repeated → The future sustains momentum and improves decision-making.",
    "Transcendent": "Focusing on what moves the needle is part of cultural DNA → The future thrives with disciplined resource use and accelerating results."

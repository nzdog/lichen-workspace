  "Title": "Sensing the Whole System",
  "Short Title": "Whole System",
  "Overall Purpose": "To cultivate the capacity to perceive the interconnections, rhythms, and underlying health of the entire system—not just its visible outputs—so actions are grounded in systemic reality.",
  "Why This Matters": "Focusing only on parts of the system creates blind spots. By sensing the whole, you can anticipate shifts, detect early signs of strain or opportunity, and move with alignment across all dimensions.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when you need to make strategic decisions, navigate uncertainty, or detect subtle signals of change before they become urgent.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You track only immediate or local signals → The future reacts to crises instead of anticipating them.",
    "Expected": "You occasionally zoom out to see patterns → The future makes some proactive moves but misses deeper currents.",
    "Excellent": "You regularly sense and interpret the whole system → The future aligns actions with deeper patterns and opportunities.",
    "Transcendent": "Whole-system sensing becomes second nature → The future moves in harmony with emergent conditions and systemic truth."

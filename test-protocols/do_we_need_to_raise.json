  "Title": "Do We Need to Raise?",
  "Short Title": "Funding Necessity Check",
  "Overall Purpose": "To determine whether raising external capital is truly necessary, or if alternative strategies can achieve current goals without taking on investor constraints.",
  "Why This Matters": "Raising money can accelerate growth—but it also brings obligations, expectations, and potential loss of control. Many companies raise when they could instead optimize, partner, or pace themselves.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When considering a new funding round\nWhen pressure to raise comes from external stakeholders\nWhen evaluating multiple growth paths\nWhen wanting to protect autonomy and flexibility",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Decision to raise is made reactively or from fear of missing out → The future risks misalignment and wasted dilution.",
    "Expected": "Some analysis done, but emotional or external pressure drives the decision → The future gains some benefit, but with preventable trade-offs.",
    "Excellent": "Decision is based on clear strategic, financial, and cultural analysis → The future benefits from capital only when it truly serves the build.",
    "Transcendent": "Funding necessity is evaluated as cultural reflex—capital is used as a precise tool, never a default → The future compounds both autonomy and impact."

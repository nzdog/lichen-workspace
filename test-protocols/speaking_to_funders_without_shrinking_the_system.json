  "Title": "Speaking to Funders Without Shrinking the System",
  "Short Title": "Funders Without Shrinkage",
  "Overall Purpose": "To communicate the vision, value, and integrity of the system to funders in a way that maintains its full scope, complexity, and long-term intent.",
  "Why This Matters": "In efforts to appeal to funders, there is a risk of oversimplifying or altering the system’s essence. Protecting its wholeness in communication ensures that funding supports the actual vision rather than a diluted version.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When preparing funding pitches or proposals\nWhen refining messaging for philanthropic or investment audiences\nWhen training team members to represent the system to funders\nWhen re-engaging existing funders with updates",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Messaging is oversimplified or altered to match perceived funder preferences → The future sees mission drift and reduced integrity.",
    "Expected": "Some elements of wholeness are preserved, but complexity is softened for accessibility → The future risks gradual narrowing of vision.",
    "Excellent": "The system is communicated in its full truth and value while remaining accessible → The future receives aligned funding without distortion.",
    "Transcendent": "Speaking in wholeness is cultural instinct—funders engage with and protect the system’s integrity → The future compounds resources and trust."

  "Title": "Naming What's Not Working",
  "Short Title": "Identify Issues",
  "Overall Purpose": "To create a space where challenges and inefficiencies can be openly identified and addressed, fostering a culture of transparency and continuous improvement.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without naming what isn't working, problems persist and compound, leading to inefficiencies, frustration, and missed opportunities for growth and innovation.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when recurring issues arise, during team reflections, or when progress feels stalled despite efforts.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You avoid addressing issues and let them fester → The future is burdened with unresolved problems and declining morale.",
    "Expected": "You identify some issues but overlook others → The future experiences sporadic improvements but persistent underlying problems.",
    "Excellent": "You consistently name and address issues openly → The future benefits from steady growth and enhanced team dynamics.",
    "Transcendent": "Naming issues becomes a natural and integral part of the culture → The future thrives on adaptability and proactive problem-solving."

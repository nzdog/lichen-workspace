  "Short Title": "Conflict Integrity",
  "Overall Purpose": "To guide individuals and teams in restoring trust and integrity after conflicts, ensuring that relationships are repaired and strengthened.",

  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use after any interpersonal or team conflict, when trust has been compromised, or when unresolved issues impact collaboration.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You ignore conflicts or address them superficially → The future inherits lingering distrust and unresolved tensions.",
    "Expected": "You address conflicts with some openness but lack full resolution → The future experiences partial healing but recurring issues.",
    "Excellent": "You engage with conflicts openly and thoroughly → The future sustains trust and stronger relationships.",
    "Transcendent": "Conflict resolution becomes a natural, integral process → The future thrives on trust and adaptive resilience."

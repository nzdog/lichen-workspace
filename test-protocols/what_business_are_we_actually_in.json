  "Short Title": "Core Business Clarity",
  "Overall Purpose": "To clarify the true nature of our business—beyond products, services, or current markets—so that decisions and strategies align with our real identity and purpose.",
  "Why This Matters": "Misunderstanding what business we are truly in leads to misplaced investments, diluted focus, and missed opportunities. Clarity ensures we adapt without losing our essence.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "During strategic planning or rebranding\nWhen growth opportunities pull in conflicting directions\nAfter a major market shift or disruption\nWhen internal teams have differing views on the organization’s purpose",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "We define ourselves by our current outputs only → The future risks irrelevance when markets change.",
    "Expected": "We have some sense of our deeper business, but still operate narrowly → The future adapts slowly to change.",
    "Excellent": "We clearly articulate and align to our true business → The future stays relevant and focused.",
    "Transcendent": "Our true business is embedded in culture—guiding every choice and evolution → The future thrives through change without losing its core."

  "Title": "The Rhythm of Legacy",
  "Short Title": "Legacy Rhythm",
  "Overall Purpose": "To align daily actions and long-term vision so that the work we do now contributes meaningfully to the legacy we want to leave.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without connecting present choices to long-term impact, teams risk chasing short-term wins that do not build toward a meaningful future. Legacy grows from consistent, intentional rhythm.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When setting strategic priorities\nDuring annual or multi-year planning\nTo evaluate whether current work aligns with deeper purpose\nWhen facing pressure to compromise long-term values for short-term gains",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Daily work is disconnected from long-term vision → The future sees fragmented results and unfulfilled mission.",
    "Expected": "Some work aligns to long-term goals but without consistent tracking → The future delivers partial legacy building.",
    "Excellent": "Daily rhythm is consciously linked to long-term vision → The future steadily builds the intended legacy.",
    "Transcendent": "Legacy rhythm is cultural DNA → The future flourishes with sustained impact and integrity."

  "Short Title": "Clarifying Our True Audience",
  "Overall Purpose": "To clarify the real audience, community, or stakeholders we are committed to serving—ensuring our work remains aligned with their needs and our integrity, rather than drifting toward easier wins or louder voices.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without clarity about who we are truly here for, decisions can drift toward pleasing the most vocal, influential, or financially powerful stakeholders instead of those we are uniquely positioned and committed to serve.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When making strategic or product decisions\nDuring brand, messaging, or positioning work\nWhen noticing pressure to serve audiences outside our original scope\nIn moments of mission drift or internal debate about priorities",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "We orient toward whoever is loudest or easiest to reach → The future loses connection to our core mission and community.",
    "Expected": "We have a general sense of our audience but make compromises under pressure → The future delivers partial alignment and inconsistent impact.",
    "Excellent": "We have a clear, specific definition of who we are here for and make decisions accordingly → The future deepens trust, relevance, and loyalty.",
    "Transcendent": "Our clarity about who we serve is cultural and self-reinforcing → The future sustains integrity, impact, and resonance over time."

  "Title": "Mapping What’s Emerging",
  "Short Title": "Mapping Emerging",
  "Overall Purpose": "To make visible the signals, shifts, and possibilities that are beginning to take shape—before they become fixed—so choices can be made with clarity and alignment.",
  "Why This Matters": "Early sensing allows you to shape the direction rather than just respond to it. Without mapping, you may overlook key signals or miss the chance to influence outcomes while they’re still forming.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when entering a new market, after a significant shift, or when multiple possible futures are present and you need to clarify direction.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You ignore or dismiss early signals → The future surprises you with avoidable crises or missed opportunities.",
    "Expected": "You notice some emerging patterns but act on them inconsistently → The future captures partial opportunities and mitigates some risks.",
    "Excellent": "You regularly map emerging signals and test their implications → The future positions you ahead of shifts with informed, timely action.",
    "Transcendent": "Mapping emerging patterns is embedded in your culture → The future consistently shapes its environment rather than being shaped by it."

  "Title": "Team Protocol – Relational Repair",
  "Short Title": "Relational Repair (Team)",
  "Overall Purpose": "To restore trust, understanding, and effective collaboration within a team after conflict, misunderstanding, or harm.",
  "Why This Matters": "Unrepaired relational fractures in a team erode trust, reduce performance, and create ongoing tension. Repairing relationships proactively strengthens the foundation for future work.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when tension, conflict, or a breakdown in trust has occurred within a team, and you want to restore alignment, connection, and collaborative capacity.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You ignore or avoid the strain → The future carries unresolved tension, mistrust, and reduced effectiveness.",
    "Expected": "You address the surface issues but not the underlying dynamics → The future remains functional but prone to repeated breakdowns.",
    "Excellent": "You address both surface and root issues, restoring trust and collaboration → The future moves forward stronger and more resilient.",
    "Transcendent": "Relational repair is embedded in team culture → The future consistently turns conflict into growth and deeper connection."

  "Overall Purpose": "To ensure that hiring decisions align with the system's values, needs, and future direction, creating clarity and coherence in roles and responsibilities.",
  "Why This Matters": "Misaligned hiring leads to role confusion, wasted resources, and potential system disruption. Clarity and alignment in hiring foster a resilient and adaptive system.",

    "Poor": "Messaging is oversimplified or altered to match perceived funder preferences → The future sees mission drift and reduced integrity.",
    "Transcendent": "Speaking in wholeness is cultural instinct—funders engage with and protect the system’s integrity → The future compounds resources and trust."

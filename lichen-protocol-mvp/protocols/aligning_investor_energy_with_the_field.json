  "Title": "Aligning Investor Energy with the Field",
  "Short Title": "Investor–Field Energy Fit",
  "Overall Purpose": "To ensure that investor energy, expectations, and influence reinforce the health, rhythm, and direction of the broader field you serve—not just the needs of the company or portfolio.",
  "Why This Matters": "Investors can amplify or distort the energy in a field. Aligning their energy with the field ensures growth benefits the whole ecosystem, not just short-term returns.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When selecting investors for a raise\nWhen onboarding new investors\nWhen recalibrating investor relationships\nWhen expanding influence in a mission-driven field",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Investor energy is misaligned with the field → The future sees friction, extraction, and weakened trust in the ecosystem.",
    "Expected": "Some alignment exists, but key differences remain unaddressed → The future grows unevenly, with pockets of misfit influence.",
    "Excellent": "Investor energy is actively aligned with the field’s health and momentum → The future benefits from amplified impact and trust.",
    "Transcendent": "Investor–field alignment is cultural instinct—every investor becomes a steward of the field’s thriving → The future compounds coherence and resilience."

  "Title": "Handing It On: Transitioning with Integrity",
  "Short Title": "Transition Integrity",
  "Overall Purpose": "To ensure seamless transitions by honoring the essence of the work and the people involved, fostering continuity and growth.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without a thoughtful transition, valuable insights and relationships can be lost, leading to disruption and misalignment. Ensuring integrity in transitions supports sustained progress and trust.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use during leadership changes, project handoffs, or when key team members are departing.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Transitions occur abruptly without preparation → The future faces confusion and loss of momentum.",
    "Expected": "Some transition elements are managed, but gaps remain → The future experiences partial continuity and occasional setbacks.",
    "Excellent": "Transitions are planned and executed with care and clarity → The future maintains steady progress and relational trust.",
    "Transcendent": "Transition integrity becomes a cultural norm → The future evolves seamlessly, with deepened trust and resilience."

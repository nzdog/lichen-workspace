  "Short Title": "Funding Narrative",
  "Overall Purpose": "To craft a coherent and compelling funding narrative that aligns with our mission and attracts sustainable financial support.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without a clear funding narrative, organizations struggle to communicate their value, leading to missed opportunities for support and growth. A well-defined narrative ensures alignment with funders and stakeholders.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when developing fundraising strategies, during budget planning, or when seeking new funding sources.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You present a disjointed funding story → The future faces inconsistent support and financial instability.",
    "Expected": "You articulate a basic funding narrative but lack depth → The future experiences sporadic engagement and moderate growth.",
    "Excellent": "You convey a clear and resonant funding narrative → The future enjoys steady support and strategic partnerships.",

  "Title": "The Energy Behind the Ask",
  "Short Title": "Ask Energy Check",
  "Overall Purpose": "To ensure that the motivation, clarity, and relational posture behind a funding or partnership ask align with integrity, resonance, and long-term fit.",
  "Why This Matters": "The intention and energy behind an ask shape how it is received, the quality of the relationship, and the sustainability of any agreement.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When preparing to make a funding or partnership ask\nWhen aligning internal teams on the purpose and tone of an ask\nWhen refining a pitch or proposal\nWhen assessing why an ask may have been declined",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "The ask is driven by desperation, ego, or misalignment → The future risks strained relationships and compromised positioning.",
    "Expected": "The ask has some clarity and alignment, but mixed signals remain → The future gains partial success but with relational friction.",
    "Excellent": "The ask is grounded in clarity, confidence, and mutual value → The future builds strong, aligned partnerships.",
    "Transcendent": "A culturally embedded practice ensures every ask radiates integrity, resonance, and mutual benefit → The future compounds trust and influence."

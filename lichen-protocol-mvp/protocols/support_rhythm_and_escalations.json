  "Title": "Support Rhythm & Escalations",
  "Short Title": "Support & Escalations",
  "Overall Purpose": "To establish a predictable support rhythm and clear escalation paths that ensure timely, effective resolution of customer issues.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without a consistent rhythm and defined escalation process, support teams risk slow responses, missed commitments, and customer dissatisfaction. Predictable rhythms and clear escalation paths build trust and retention.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when designing or refining customer support processes to improve resolution speed, quality, and predictability.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Support is reactive, unstructured, and inconsistent → The future risks high churn and reputation damage.",
    "Expected": "Support has some structure but inconsistent escalation handling → The future sees uneven customer satisfaction.",
    "Excellent": "Support rhythm is reliable and escalations are handled promptly and effectively → The future drives strong retention and trust.",
    "Transcendent": "Support rhythm and escalation excellence is a cultural norm → The future sustains loyalty, advocacy, and operational calm."

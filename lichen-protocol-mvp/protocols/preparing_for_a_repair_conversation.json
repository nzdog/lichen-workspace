  "Title": "Preparing for a Repair Conversation",
  "Short Title": "Repair Prep",
  "Overall Purpose": "To equip individuals with the tools and mindset necessary to engage in conversations that mend and strengthen relationships, fostering understanding and resolution.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without preparation, repair conversations can escalate conflicts, deepen misunderstandings, and damage trust. Thoughtful preparation ensures a constructive dialogue that heals and builds stronger connections.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when a relationship has experienced tension or conflict, when misunderstandings have occurred, or when trust needs rebuilding.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You enter the conversation unprepared and defensive → The future sees further erosion of trust and unresolved tensions.",
    "Expected": "You prepare somewhat but miss key aspects → The future holds partial resolution but lingering issues.",
    "Excellent": "You prepare thoroughly, considering all perspectives → The future enjoys restored trust and strengthened bonds.",
    "Transcendent": "Preparation becomes a natural part of your relational practice → The future thrives on deepened understanding and resilience."

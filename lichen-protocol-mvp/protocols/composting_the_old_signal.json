  "Title": "Composting the Old Signal",
  "Short Title": "Signal Composting",
  "Overall Purpose": "To transform outdated signals into fertile ground for new growth, ensuring that past patterns inform future innovation.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without composting old signals, outdated patterns can clutter our processes, stifling innovation and growth. By composting, we create space for new insights and opportunities to emerge.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "- During periods of transition or change\n- When old patterns persist despite new strategies\n- When innovation feels stifled or stagnant",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You ignore outdated signals → The future is burdened with clutter and missed opportunities.",
    "Expected": "You occasionally compost old signals → The future sees some renewal but also recurring stagnation.",
    "Excellent": "You regularly transform old signals into new insights → The future thrives on continuous innovation.",
    "Transcendent": "Signal composting becomes second nature → The future evolves with dynamic, adaptive growth."

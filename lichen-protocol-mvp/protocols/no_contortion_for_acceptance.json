  "Title": "No Contortion for Acceptance",
  "Overall Purpose": "To walk without twisting into shapes for approval, holding integrity even when uncomfortable.",
  "Why This Matters": "Contortion corrodes signal and drains rhythm. Without this protocol, founders bend to survive but lose coherence. Walking it restores straightness, resilience, and trust.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": 
    "When tempted to alter core message to please investors or when bending role or identity to fit external expectations or when subtle distortion creeps into communication to win approval."
  ,
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Founder compromises signal for approval; long-term erosion of integrity.",
    "Expected": "Founder notices contortion, names it, and takes one aligned step.",
    "Excellent": "Founder consistently resists contortion; team culture shifts toward integrity.",
    "Transcendent": "Integrity radiates outward; the field itself adjusts to straightness."

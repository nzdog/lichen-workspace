  "Short Title": "Power in Conflict",
  "Overall Purpose": "To understand and manage power dynamics in conflicts, ensuring equitable resolutions and fostering trust within the system.",
  "Why This Matters": "Unchecked power dynamics can exacerbate conflicts, leading to inequitable outcomes and eroded trust. Navigating power thoughtfully promotes fairness and collaboration.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use during conflicts where power imbalances are evident, when past conflicts have led to unresolved tensions, or when striving for equitable solutions.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Power dynamics are ignored, leading to unresolved conflicts and entrenched inequities.",
    "Expected": "Power is acknowledged but not effectively managed, resulting in partial resolutions and lingering tensions.",
    "Excellent": "Power dynamics are skillfully navigated, fostering equitable resolutions and strengthened relationships.",
    "Transcendent": "Power navigation becomes intuitive, creating a culture of fairness and mutual respect in conflicts."

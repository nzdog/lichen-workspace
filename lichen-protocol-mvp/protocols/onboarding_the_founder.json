  "Title": "Onboarding the Founder",
  "Short Title": "Founder Onboarding",
  "Overall Purpose": "To integrate a new founder into the system with integrity and alignment, ensuring they are oriented, connected, and clear on their role while establishing sustainable rhythms that honor both their journey and the system's needs.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without a structured onboarding process, a new founder may feel disconnected, unclear about their role, and misaligned with the system's values and rhythms. This can lead to friction, miscommunication, and missed opportunities for growth and cohesion.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When a new founder joins the system, during the initial stages of founder integration, or when recalibrating the founder's role within the system.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "The founder feels isolated and unclear about their role → The future inherits misalignment and potential discord.",
    "Expected": "The founder is somewhat integrated but lacks full clarity or connection → The future experiences partial alignment and occasional friction.",
    "Excellent": "The founder is well-integrated, clear on their role, and connected to the system → The future sustains alignment and harmonious growth.",
    "Transcendent": "The founder's integration elevates the system's coherence and vitality → The future moves with unity and shared purpose, adapting fluidly."

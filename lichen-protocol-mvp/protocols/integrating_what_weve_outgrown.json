  "Title": "Integrating What We’ve Outgrown",
  "Short Title": "Integrating Outgrown",
  "Overall Purpose": "To consciously integrate lessons, assets, and identity shifts from what is no longer a fit—transforming endings into foundations for the next chapter.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without integration, we either cling to the old or discard it entirely, losing valuable experience and creating hidden residue in the system.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when ending a product, role, market, process, or identity that once served but no longer fits the system’s direction.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You abruptly abandon what’s outgrown → The future repeats avoidable mistakes and loses valuable insight.",
    "Expected": "You acknowledge the end but skip deeper integration → The future carries some learning but leaves residue unprocessed.",
    "Excellent": "You intentionally harvest lessons and carry forward what’s useful → The future builds on solid, integrated foundations.",
    "Transcendent": "Integration becomes cultural practice → The future evolves with compounding wisdom and minimal drag."

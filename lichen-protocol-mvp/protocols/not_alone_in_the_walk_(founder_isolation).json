  "Title": "Not Alone in the Walk (Founder Isolation)",
  "Short Title": "Founder Isolation",
  "Overall Purpose": "To illuminate and alleviate the isolation often felt by founders, creating pathways for support and resilience that honor the journey without disconnecting from the self or others.",
  "Why This Matters": "Founders often carry the weight of their vision alone, leading to burnout and decision fatigue. Without addressing isolation, the journey can become unsustainable and the vision compromised.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": 
    "When feelings of isolation or overwhelm arise, During major decision-making periods, When seeking to build or strengthen support networks"
  ,
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You continue to carry the burden alone → The future bears the strain of isolation, risking burnout and vision drift.",
    "Expected": "You occasionally seek support but still feel isolated at times → The future experiences moments of relief but lacks consistent resilience.",
    "Excellent": "You actively weave in support structures → The future thrives with sustained energy and aligned vision.",
    "Transcendent": "Support and connection become integral to your journey → The future unfolds with resilience and shared strength, adapting with ease."

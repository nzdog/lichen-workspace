  "Title": "Stewardship Over Ownership",
  "Short Title": "Stewardship",
  "Overall Purpose": "To cultivate a mindset of stewardship rather than ownership, fostering a sense of responsibility and care for the system as a whole.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without stewardship, systems become fragmented and self-serving, leading to inefficiencies and misaligned goals. Embracing stewardship ensures alignment with the system's core values and long-term health.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "- When transitioning leadership roles\n- During strategic planning sessions\n- When addressing conflicts of interest",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You treat the system as a possession → The future becomes fragmented and self-serving.",
    "Expected": "You occasionally consider stewardship but default to ownership → The future experiences mixed alignment and occasional conflict.",
    "Excellent": "You consistently act as a steward, not an owner → The future sustains harmony and collective progress.",
    "Transcendent": "Stewardship becomes a cultural norm → The future thrives with shared responsibility and purpose."

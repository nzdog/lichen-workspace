  "Title": "Building a Field-Aligned Sales Process",
  "Short Title": "Field-Aligned Sales",
  "Overall Purpose": "To design a sales process that matches real customer contexts, needs, and decision-making patterns in the field.",
  "Why This Matters": "A sales process disconnected from the realities of customer behavior leads to wasted effort, poor conversion, and missed opportunities. Field alignment ensures relevance, trust, and efficiency.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when creating or refining the sales process, entering new markets, or after significant feedback from field reps or customers.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You design sales steps in isolation from customer reality → The future risks low adoption and conversion.",
    "Expected": "You incorporate some field insights but inconsistently → The future sees uneven performance.",
    "Excellent": "You build the process from field data and customer realities → The future creates predictable, high-quality conversions.",
    "Transcendent": "Field alignment is embedded in sales culture—processes adapt quickly to market shifts → The future sustains strong, resilient sales performance."

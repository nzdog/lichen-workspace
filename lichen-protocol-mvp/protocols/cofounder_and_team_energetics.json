  "Title": "Co-Founder and Team Energetics",
  "Short Title": "Team Energetics",
  "Overall Purpose": "To intentionally manage and align the interpersonal energy dynamics between co-founders and the wider team, ensuring resilience, trust, and sustainable collaboration.",
  "Why This Matters": "Energetic alignment shapes how decisions are made, how conflicts are navigated, and how momentum is sustained. Mismanaged energetics lead to hidden friction, burnout, and cultural erosion.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When sensing tension or energy imbalances between leaders and team\nDuring periods of rapid change or scaling\nWhen onboarding new key team members\nTo strengthen relational trust and collaborative flow",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Energetic misalignments go unnoticed or unaddressed → The future sees decreased trust, rising tension, and inconsistent performance.",
    "Expected": "Some attention to energy dynamics but inconsistently → The future delivers partial improvements but recurring friction.",
    "Excellent": "Energetics are actively observed, discussed, and aligned → The future sustains trust, high performance, and morale.",
    "Transcendent": "Energetic stewardship is part of the cultural DNA → The future thrives with deep trust, cohesion, and shared resilience."

  "Overall Purpose": "To clarify which type of funder best serves your next move—not just who’s willing to write a cheque.",
  "Why This Matters": "Not all money is the same. The wrong investor can distort your rhythm, culture, and direction.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "When preparing to raise capital\nWhen choosing between angel investors, venture capital, or other funding sources\nWhen assessing whether to accept an unsolicited offer\nWhen wanting to protect strategic direction and cultural integrity",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "Funding choice is driven purely by availability → The future risks misaligned expectations and control issues.",
    "Expected": "Some fit assessment is done, but major differences in funder expectations remain unaddressed → The future faces occasional conflicts.",
    "Excellent": "Funder choice aligns with strategy, culture, and rhythm → The future grows with both capital and integrity intact.",
    "Transcendent": "Cultural instinct ensures funding always strengthens, never distorts, the build → The future compounds alignment and momentum."

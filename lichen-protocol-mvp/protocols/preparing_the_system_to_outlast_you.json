  "Short Title": "System Longevity",
  "Overall Purpose": "To ensure the systems we build continue to thrive and evolve beyond our direct involvement, fostering resilience and sustainability.",
  "Why This Matters": "Without intentional preparation, systems may falter when key individuals leave, leading to loss of knowledge, continuity, and potential. Ensuring longevity protects the system's integrity and purpose.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Use when planning transitions, during leadership changes, or when systems show dependency on specific individuals.",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "You leave without preparing the system for your absence → The future struggles with gaps and instability.",
    "Expected": "You create some continuity plans but leave key areas unaddressed → The future experiences partial resilience and sporadic challenges.",
    "Excellent": "You establish robust structures and knowledge-sharing practices → The future maintains stability and growth.",
    "Transcendent": "The system adapts seamlessly to changes in leadership → The future thrives with autonomy and innovation."

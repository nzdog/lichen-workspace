# Integration & Commit Room

## Overview

The Integration & Commit Room is a critical component of the Lichen Protocol Room Architecture (PRA) that enforces the capture of integration data and commitment recording before session closure. This room ensures system continuity by requiring structured capture of session insights and next steps with proper pace governance.

## Core Purpose

The Integration & Commit Room serves as the final checkpoint before session termination, ensuring that:

1. **Integration data is captured** - Session insights, shifts, and key learnings are recorded
2. **Commitments are structured** - Next steps are clearly defined with context and pace
3. **Pace is enforced** - Every commitment must have a pace state (NOW/HOLD/LATER/SOFT_HOLD)
4. **Memory is written atomically** - Integration and commitments are persisted together
5. **Closure is controlled** - Room cannot complete until all requirements are met

## Key Features

### ✅ Integration Enforcement
- **Required Fields**: `integration_notes` and `session_context` are mandatory
- **Quality Validation**: Content must be meaningful (no placeholders, minimum length)
- **Structured Data**: Supports optional `key_insights` and `shifts_noted` arrays
- **Prevents Closure**: Room blocks completion until integration is captured

### ✅ Commitment Recording
- **Structured Format**: Each commitment requires text, context, pace_state, and session_ref
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are present and valid
- **Multiple Commitments**: Supports recording multiple commitments per session
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains session context for each commitment

### ✅ Pace Enforcement
- **Required Pace States**: NOW, HOLD, LATER, SOFT_HOLD are enforced on every commitment
- **Action Mapping**: Maps pace states to room next_action (NOW→continue, HOLD→hold, LATER→later)
- **Consistency Checking**: Warns about potential pace imbalances
- **Rejection Policy**: Rejects commitments without pace states

### ✅ Atomic Memory Write
- **Transaction-like Semantics**: Integration and commitments written together
- **No Partial Writes**: Either all data is written or nothing
- **Memory Room Interface**: Simulates Memory Room integration for MVP
- **Write History**: Tracks all write attempts for debugging

### ✅ Completion Control
- **Requirement Validation**: Checks all completion requirements before allowing closure
- **Fixed Marker**: Appends `[[COMPLETE]]` marker to all responses
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows completion percentage and missing requirements
- **State Management**: Maintains session state across operations

## Usage

### Basic Integration Capture
```python
from rooms.integration_commit_room import run_integration_commit_room
from rooms.integration_commit_room.contract_types import IntegrationCommitRoomInput

# Capture integration data
input_data = IntegrationCommitRoomInput(
    session_state_ref="session-123",
    payload={
        "integration_notes": "Feeling more grounded and centered after the session",
        "session_context": "Morning meditation practice focusing on breath awareness",
        "key_insights": [
            "Breath awareness helps ground attention",
            "Body scanning reveals tension patterns"
        ],
        "shifts_noted": [
            "From scattered to focused attention",
            "From tense to relaxed body state"
        ]
    }
)

result = run_integration_commit_room(input_data)
# Returns: Integration captured successfully with summary [[COMPLETE]]
```

### Commitment Recording
```python
# Record commitments with pace states
commitments_input = IntegrationCommitRoomInput(
    session_state_ref="session-123",
    payload={
        "commitments": [
            {
                "text": "Practice daily morning meditation for 15 minutes",
                "context": "Morning routine before breakfast",
                "pace_state": "NOW",
                "session_ref": "session-123"
            },
            {
                "text": "Read mindfulness book for 30 minutes",
                "context": "Evening wind-down routine",
                "pace_state": "LATER",
                "session_ref": "session-123"
            }
        ]
    }
)

result = run_integration_commit_room(commitments_input)
# Returns: Commitments recorded successfully with pace summary [[COMPLETE]]
```

### Room Completion
```python
# Complete the room and write to memory
completion_input = IntegrationCommitRoomInput(
    session_state_ref="session-123",
    payload={"complete": True}
)

result = run_integration_commit_room(completion_input)
# Returns: Completion summary with memory write confirmation [[COMPLETE]]
# next_action determined by commitment pace states
```

### Status Checking
```python
# Check room status and progress
status_input = IntegrationCommitRoomInput(
    session_state_ref="session-123",
    payload={"status": True}
)

result = run_integration_commit_room(status_input)
# Returns: Current status with completion percentage [[COMPLETE]]
```

## Contract Compliance

### Input Contract
The room accepts `IntegrationCommitRoomInput` with:
- `session_state_ref`: String identifier for the session
- `payload`: Operation-specific data (integration data, commitments, etc.)

### Output Contract
The room returns `IntegrationCommitRoomOutput` with:
- `display_text`: Human-readable response with completion marker
- `next_action`: Determined by commitment pace states (continue/hold/later)

### Required Fields

#### Integration Data
- **integration_notes**: String (min 10 chars, no placeholders)
- **session_context**: String (min 5 chars, no placeholders)
- **key_insights**: Optional array of strings
- **shifts_noted**: Optional array of strings

#### Commitments
- **text**: String (min 3 chars)
- **context**: String (min 2 chars)
- **pace_state**: One of "NOW", "HOLD", "LATER", "SOFT_HOLD"
- **session_ref**: String reference to session

## Pace State Mapping

### Pace States
- **NOW**: Ready to proceed immediately → `next_action: "continue"`
- **HOLD**: Pause here until ready → `next_action: "hold"`
- **SOFT_HOLD**: Brief pause, can continue when ready → `next_action: "hold"`
- **LATER**: Schedule for later session → `next_action: "later"`

### Priority Order
The room's `next_action` is determined by the most restrictive pace state:
1. **LATER** (highest priority) → `next_action: "later"`
2. **HOLD/SOFT_HOLD** → `next_action: "hold"`
3. **NOW** (lowest priority) → `next_action: "continue"`

## Error Handling

### Structured Decline Responses
All validation failures return structured `DeclineResponse` objects with:
- `reason`: Enum indicating failure type
- `message`: Human-readable error message
- `details`: Additional error context
- `required_fields`: List of missing or invalid fields

### Error Types
- **MISSING_INTEGRATION**: Required integration data not provided
- **INVALID_COMMITMENT_STRUCTURE**: Commitment data malformed
- **MISSING_PACE_STATE**: Commitment missing pace state
- **MEMORY_WRITE_FAILED**: Memory persistence failed
- **INVALID_INPUT**: General input validation failure

### Graceful Degradation
- **No Crashes**: All errors are caught and returned as structured responses
- **State Preservation**: Failed operations don't modify room state
- **Clear Messaging**: Error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Completion Marker**: All responses include the completion marker

## Testing

- Commitment data (text, context, pace, session ref)
- Atomic write confirmation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

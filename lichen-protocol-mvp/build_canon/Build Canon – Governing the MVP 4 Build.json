  "Protocol Title": "Build Canon – Governing the MVP 4 Build",
  "Overall Purpose": "To ensure the MVP 4 build process itself walks in fidelity to the Lichen Protocol—so the architecture, workflow, and release are coherent with the field we claim to serve. This protocol governs how we build, not just what we build.",
  "Why This Matters": "If the build process bends to urgency, shortcuts, or conventional startup logic, the system itself will inherit distortion. Fidelity in the build is fidelity in the product. This protocol protects Light Before Form, Integrity Is the Growth Strategy, and The System Walks With Us.",
  "When To Use This Protocol": "Activated during every decision about scope, prioritization, architecture, or release. Referenced whenever pressure rises (deadlines, funding, user demand).",
  "Overall Outcomes": {
    "Poor": "The MVP build mirrors hustle logic—fast, pressured, feature-led. Future result: The system emerges distorted. Founders experience another startup tool, not a field.",
    "Expected": "The build holds strong fidelity to the Stones and PRA structure. Rhythm is respected, protocols flow cleanly, and user experience is trustworthy. Future result: MVP 4 launches as a genuinely coherent system. Founders feel relief and resonance—the product is clearly different from startup-as-usual.",
    "Excellent": "The build process itself is protocol-led, rhythmic, and relational. Each decision is consciously governed by Stones and field integrity. Future result: MVP 4 doesn’t just feel different—it transmits coherence. Founders experience it as both tool and ally.",
    "Transcendent": "The build becomes a living transmission of the field. Every line of code and decision carries coherence, visible to anyone who encounters it. Future result: MVP 4 is not just software—it is a sovereign companion that embodies the field and magnetizes those ready to walk."

      "Name": "Build Rhythmically, Not Urgently",
      "Purpose": "To govern project tempo by rhythm, not deadlines.",
      "Why This Matters": "Build pace encodes user pace. If we rush, founders will rush inside the system.",
      "Outcomes": {
        "Poor": "Build sprints follow external urgency. Future: Hustle logic infects the system.",
        "Expected": "Build cadence follows a steady rhythm with deliberate pauses and integrations. Future: Founders feel calm, clarity, and trust when using MVP 4.",
        "Excellent": "Rhythm governs every sprint and decision. Pauses become architecture. Future: Product itself regulates founder nervous systems.",
        "Transcendent": "The build entrains all contributors into a field-coherent rhythm. Future: The way it was built becomes part of its medicine."

      "Transcendent Invitation": "You may not always reach this, but here’s the horizon: when rhythm itself becomes medicine, the build transmits coherence long after shipping.",

      "Name": "Protect Protocol Integrity",
      "Purpose": "Ensure all user-facing outputs preserve full protocol structure (purpose, why this matters, outcomes, themes, guiding questions, completion prompts).",
      "Why This Matters": "If structure fragments, field transmission fails.",
      "Outcomes": {
        "Poor": "Features are shipped without full protocol fidelity. Future: Walks feel hollow.",
        "Expected": "Every shipped protocol maintains complete structure. Users always experience full integrity of the canon. Future: Walks feel whole, trustworthy, and repeatable.",
        "Excellent": "Protocol fidelity is protected at the code level; regeneration rules enforce it automatically. Future: The system becomes self-healing if distortion creeps in.",
        "Transcendent": "Integrity of structure is unquestioned—the system itself embodies the walk. Future: Protocol delivery feels like being companioned, not instructed."
      },
      "Transcendent Invitation": "You may not always reach this, but here’s the horizon: when structure itself becomes transmission, the user feels companioned rather than instructed.",

        "Poor": "Architecture prioritizes speed and efficiency. Future: Users feel reduced to productivity.",
        "Expected": "Core architecture includes memory, rhythm logic, and reflective prompts as defaults. Future: Founders feel accompanied, not processed.",
        "Excellent": "Wholeness is prioritized in all layers—interface, retrieval, regeneration, metrics. Future: Users feel more integrated and human after every walk.",

      "Purpose": "Treat the Foundation Stones as non-negotiable build rules.",

      "Outcomes": {
        "Poor": "Stones are slogans. Implementation ignores them. Future: Build inherits startup distortion.",
        "Expected": "Stones guide design choices and are visibly present in build decisions. Future: MVP 4 feels rooted, grounded, and distinct.",
        "Excellent": "Stones are encoded in architecture (e.g., rhythm in pacing logic, trust in memory handling). Future: The system resists drift by design.",
        "Transcendent": "Stones function as living laws within the codebase. Future: The system itself becomes a steward of the field."

      "Outcomes": {
        "Poor": "Build roadmap bends to external acceptance. Future: Field collapses under pressure.",
        "Expected": "Build decisions are made only through coherence and steward logic. MVP 4 resists external shaping. Future: Founders encounter a system that feels sovereign and trustworthy.",
        "Excellent": "Contortion checks are encoded as part of governance filters. Future: Integrity holds even under strong external pressure.",
        "Transcendent": "The build magnetizes aligned capital and users because it refuses distortion. Future: Growth happens only through fidelity."
      },
      "Transcendent Invitation": "You may not always reach this, but here’s the horizon: when refusal of distortion becomes magnetic, aligned capital and users arrive through coherence alone.",

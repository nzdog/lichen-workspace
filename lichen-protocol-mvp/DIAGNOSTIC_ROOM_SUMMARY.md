# Diagnostic Room Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Successfully built a complete, production-ready Python 3.11 implementation of the Diagnostic Room for the Lichen Protocol Room Architecture (PRA). The Diagnostic Room serves as the system's listening chamber—where the field is read before deciding the path forward.

## Design Stance (Strict Implementation)
- **Capture-only diagnostics**: No interpretation, no sentiment analysis, no ML
- **No consent logic**: Diagnostic Room does not solicit or enforce consent (handled upstream)
- **Single completion marker**: Exactly `[[COMPLETE]]` appended once
- **No policy variants**: Deterministic functions only
- **Contract compliance**: Honor schema verbatim for inputs/outputs

## Core Components Built

### 1. **DiagnosticRoom Class** - Main orchestrator
- Implements the complete protocol flow
- Configurable diagnostics toggle
- Error handling with graceful degradation

### 2. **Sensing Module** (`sensing.py`)
- **Capture-only tone and residue sensing** without interpretation
- Handles explicit signals from dict payloads
- Simple deterministic pattern matching for strings
- Defaults to "unspecified" if signals not provided
- No NLP, no sentiment analysis, no heuristics

### 3. **Readiness Module** (`readiness.py`)
- **Deterministic readiness assessment** using rule-based logic only
- Supports all four states: NOW, HOLD, LATER, SOFT_HOLD
- Respects explicit readiness_state when provided
- Applies tone-based and residue-based rules when not explicit
- No learning, no heuristics, no ML

### 4. **Mapping Module** (`mapping.py`)
- **Rule-based protocol mapping** from static registry
- Deterministic selection based on captured signals
- Fixed template rationale format
- Protocol registry includes: resourcing_mini_walk, clearing_entry, pacing_adjustment, integration_pause

### 5. **Capture Module** (`capture.py`)
- **Minimal diagnostic capture** with toggle respect
- Structured data: tone_label, residue_label, readiness_state, suggested_protocol_id
- Clean skip when disabled, never blocks flow
- Memory write simulation (ready for real storage integration)

### 6. **Completion Module** (`completion.py`)
- **Single fixed completion marker**: `[[COMPLETE]]`
- Always appended to display_text
- No variants, no policies, no alternatives

## Protocol Flow Implementation
1. **Sensing** → Capture tone_label and residue_label from input
2. **Readiness Assessment** → Compute readiness tag (NOW/HOLD/LATER/SOFT_HOLD)
3. **Protocol Mapping** → Map signals to suggested protocol with rationale
4. **Silent Capture** → Record minimal structured data if enabled
5. **Completion** → Add `[[COMPLETE]]` marker to display_text

## Contract Compliance
- **Input**: `DiagnosticRoomInput` with `session_state_ref` and `payload`
- **Output**: `DiagnosticRoomOutput` with `display_text` and `next_action` (always "continue")
- **Strict adherence** to I/O specifications with no additional properties
- **Type safety** through Python type hints

## Behavioral Invariants Implemented

### 1. **Capture-Only Sensing**
- Extracts tone_label and residue_label without interpretation
- Defaults to "unspecified" if signals not explicitly provided
- No NLP, no sentiment analysis, no heuristics

### 2. **Deterministic Readiness**
- Computes readiness tag using rule-based logic only
- Supports all four states: NOW, HOLD, LATER, SOFT_HOLD
- No learning, no heuristics, no ML

### 3. **Protocol Mapping**
- Rule-based selection from static registry
- Fixed template rationale format
- Deterministic mapping based on signals

### 4. **Silent Capture**
- Minimal structured data when enabled
- Clean skip when disabled
- Never blocks main flow

### 5. **Completion Requirement**
- display_text always ends with `[[COMPLETE]]`
- Single marker only, no variants
- Fixed string, no policies

## Testing Results
- **All tests passing** ✅
- **Comprehensive coverage** of all behavioral invariants
- **Integration testing** of complete protocol flow
- **Error handling** and edge case coverage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from diagnostic_room import run_diagnostic_room, DiagnosticRoomInput

input_data = DiagnosticRoomInput(
    session_state_ref='session-123',
    payload='I feel overwhelmed and still have unresolved issues.'
)

result = run_diagnostic_room(input_data)
print(result.display_text)    # Diagnostic info + [[COMPLETE]]
print(result.next_action)     # Always "continue"
```

### Explicit Signals
```python
input_data = DiagnosticRoomInput(
    session_state_ref='session-456',
    payload={
        'tone_label': 'urgency',
        'residue_label': 'previous_attempts',
        'readiness_state': 'NOW'
    }
)
```

### Diagnostics Toggle
```python
# Disable diagnostics capture
result = run_diagnostic_room(input_data, diagnostics_enabled=False)
```

## Key Technical Features
- **Python 3.11** with modern type hints
- **Dataclasses** for clean data structures
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation
- **No external dependencies** beyond testing framework
- **Production-ready code** with comprehensive documentation

## Protocol Registry
Static protocol registry for deterministic mapping:
- **`resourcing_mini_walk`**: For overwhelm tone
- **`clearing_entry`**: For urgency tone, default protocol
- **`pacing_adjustment`**: For worry tone, deferring residue
- **`integration_pause`**: For unresolved previous residue, HOLD readiness

## Diagnostic Data Structure
When diagnostics are enabled, minimal structured data is captured:
```python
{
    "tone_label": str,
    "residue_label": str,
    "readiness_state": str,
    "suggested_protocol_id": str
}
```

## Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** for all failure modes
- **Input errors** handled with error messages
- **Processing failures** fallback to safe defaults
- **Never throws** unhandled exceptions
- **Error messages** included in display_text with completion marker

## Production Readiness
- **Code quality**: Modern Python features and comprehensive testing
- **Deployment**: Self-contained with no external dependencies
- **Configurable**: Diagnostics toggle for different environments
- **Scalable**: Static registry easy to extend
- **Maintainable**: Clean, modular code structure

## Test Command
```bash
pytest rooms/diagnostic_room/tests/test_diagnostic_room.py
```

## Summary
The Diagnostic Room implementation is a **complete, production-ready Python 3.11 solution** that strictly adheres to the design stance requirements. It implements all themes from the Diagnostic Room Protocol with capture-only sensing, deterministic readiness assessment, rule-based protocol mapping, silent diagnostic capture, and fixed completion markers. The implementation is fully tested, documented, and ready for production deployment.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully converted from TypeScript to Python 3.11 with zero TypeScript artifacts remaining, delivering a clean, maintainable, and fully functional Diagnostic Room that serves as the system's listening chamber for adaptive protocol selection.
